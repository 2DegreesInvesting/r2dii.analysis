```

For each company, we define the build-out factor, $\chi_i$:

$$ \chi_i =  \dfrac{p_{i}(t)-p_{i}(t_0)}{P(t_0)}$$
where $p_i(t)$ is the indicator (production or capacity) of technology $i$, $t0$ is the start year of the analysis and $P(t_0)$.

We aggregate the company build-out factors to the portfolio-level, using the loan-weighted average as usual. In particular, for each loan $l_j$ to company $j$, we have: 
$$ \chi_i^{pf} = \sum_j \left[ \chi_{i,j} * \dfrac{l_j}{\sum_j l_j} \right]$$
## Caveats
It should be noted that the build-out factor $\chi$ is undefined for $0$ initial production. Intuitively, this makes sense, since you would require an "infinite percent" build-out to grow from 0. For this reason, the build-out indicator is only suggested when analyzing large companies.
