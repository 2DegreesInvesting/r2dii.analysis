### WIP docs

* commit 52bfbd940dca7a6001d6ef1b4f51ec1772688e98

The description of the arguments `market_data` and `port_data` now points for details to the documentation of the `market` and `portfolio` datasets. However, the documentation of those datasets is still work in progress. For the record, @2diiKlaus gives apparently relevant details in https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.dataraw/pull/26).

* @georgeharris2deg, do you have an updated link to details about SDA? (follows https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.analysis/pull/8#issuecomment-562548505).

### Code review (@vintented)

* commit afd5434b8583231dad8e75812f6ebb2728e76e34

`target_year` now defaults to the latest year in any dataset. This reflects
my interpretation of the description of the `target_year` argument. @vintented please let me konw if my interpretation is wrong.

* commit 0c6f8a8faa58d494eceb8406a84bf7bcfcfbc598:

The arguments `start_year` and `target_year` now must have length-1. @vintented, please let me konw if my interpretation is wrong and
we should accept inputs such as `start_year = 2019:2020` or
`target_year = 2040:2041`.
